# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Discover Python: A 365-Day Journey with the World's Most Popular Programming Language

üó£Ô∏è You've probably heard about Python - one of the most popular and powerful programming languages in the world. From web applications to artificial intelligence, from data analysis to game programming, Python has existed and thrived in many different fields. And today, we will start a challenging journey - a 365-day journey with Python.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to write Python code every day for 365 consecutive days. Each day's challenge will focus on different aspects of Python, including:

- **Core Python Concepts**: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Advanced Python Features**: Generators, decorators, context managers, and more.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementing and working with lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues, trees, and algorithms.
- **Modules and Packages**: Utilizing built-in Python modules and creating custom packages.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files, working with JSON, CSV, and other file formats.
- **Web Development**: Basics of building web applications with frameworks like Flask or Django.
- **APIs and Web Scraping**: Interacting with APIs, parsing data, and scraping websites.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Writing unit tests, debugging, and best practices.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks with Python scripts.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Creating and managing classes and objects.

## How It Works

Each day, a new Python script will be added to the repository, accompanied by:

- **Problem Description**: A brief explanation of the day's challenge.
- **Solution**: The Python code solving the challenge.
- **Explanation**: Detailed comments and explanations to help you understand the code.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kientech/365-Days-of-Python-Programming
   ```
2. **Navigate Through the Challenges**: Each day's challenge is stored in its own folder, named according to the day (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.).
3. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python day1/main.py
   ```
4. **Learn and Improve**: Review the solutions, try solving the problems yourself, and enhance your Python skills daily.
